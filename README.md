### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2020

+ Projec title: Why do these democrats want to vote for Trump?
+ This project is conducted by [Rui(Raymond) Liang]

+ Project summary: According to the data from ANES, we can find that 2020 Trump's democrats are usually well-educated white young male democrats who are earning a descent salary and have more than one child. The reasons why they vote for trump: 1)Trump's free market policy. 2)They approve his president work performance. 3)They are very likely not favor of another president candidate Joe Biden.
